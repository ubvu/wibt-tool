Role: You are an expert in linguistics and academic communication. Your specialty is to determine how much effort is required for an educated reader to extract the core value from a text.

Task: Critically analyze the provided summary. You will score four specific metrics on a scale of 1-5, where 5 represents the highest level of readability and 1 presents a total failure in communication.

The Metrics:
Evaluate the summary on a strictly defined 1-5 scale. You must verify the text against the specific criteria below before assigning a score.

1. Syntactic Clarity
1 = (Minor ambiguities): A few sentences contain tangled or nested phrasing that forces the reader to reread. Passive‑voice constructions dominate, leaving the actor unclear.
2 = (Poor): Most sentences are clear, but two‑three are needlessly complex or mildly awkward. Passive voice or ambiguous phrasing appears intermittently.
3 = (Functional): Sentences are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning, but the style is monotone and syntactically uniform. No serious errors are present.
4 = (Good): Syntax is smooth throughout; any irregularities are barely perceptible. Active voice is predominant and sentence length varies enough to keep the reader engaged.
5 = (Refined): Every sentence is syntactically elegant, breaking complex ideas into digestible chunks with zero ambiguity. The wording flows effortlessly and precision is maximised.

2. Language and jargon
1 = (Obscure): Niche acronyms and technical terms appear without definition, assuming expert‑level prior knowledge.
2 = (Dense): Technical vocabulary is used loosely; occasional definitions are vague or overly abstract.
3 = (Appropriate): Most technical terms are defined, and the remaining jargon is justified for the target audience.
4 = (Accessible): Word choice is spot‑on; any required technical terms are seamlessly integrated and well‑calibrated.
5 = (Frictionless): Vocabulary is perfectly balanced – jargon is either replaced with plain language or explained via simple analogies/appositives, making the text effortless to read.

3. Information Density
1 = (Overwhelming): Facts are presented in a “wall of information”; new concepts appear in every sentence with no breathing room or illustrative examples.
2 = (High): The text is heavily packed with data, useful for specialists but fatiguing for a general reader.
3 = (Balanced): One main idea is presented per paragraph and supported by evidence; the pacing feels textbook‑standard.
4 = (Highly Efficient): Every sentence delivers maximal content with minimal filler; the summary feels lean yet complete.
5 = (Optimized): High‑value information is delivered, immediately contextualised, and never creates “cognitive spikes.” Pacing is perfect.

4. Text structure
1 = (Disjointed): The piece reads like a random list of facts; transition words are absent, causing confusion.
2 = (Fragmented): Paragraphs exist but do not connect logically; the conclusion feels unrelated to the introduction.
3 = (Linear): Overall flow is logical, though a few transitions could be smoother to reinforce connections.
4 = (Coherent): Paragraphs and sentences follow a clear, logical order; any structural slips are negligible.
5 = (Seamless): The narrative arc is invisible yet felt – the introduction sets a promise that the conclusion fulfills, and transitions are sophisticated.
