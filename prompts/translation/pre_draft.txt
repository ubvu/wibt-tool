To start, let’s do some pre-drafting research on the context:

Research:
During this phase, thorough research is essential to address components of the context text that pose translation challenges. The goal is to establish a comprehensive translation plan that covers the following categories:
- Idiomatic Expressions:
Identify idiomatic expressions that cannot be directly translated word-for-word into Dutch (e.g., 'under the weather').
- Formality:
Determine based on the context if the text should use the formal 'u' or the informal 'je/jij'.
- Ambiguitiy:
Identify English words with multiple meanings that could lead to errors (e.g., 'draft' as a breeze vs. a document).

Output: 
A structured 'Translation Challenge Report' for the next agent.

Here is the context in which the text appears:
