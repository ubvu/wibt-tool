Your task is to identify domain-specific key facts within the document in <document></document>, which are essential pieces of information for a high-quality summary. You are provided key-fact category and description in <category></category> tags, and its example in <example></example>. Each key fact must be presented as a standalone, atomic-level sentence. The following is a set of detailed instructions in <instructions></instructions> tags for identifying key facts.

<instructions>
1. Identify Key-facts: Extract all key-facts from the text. Each key-fact should:
    - Be a complete sentence with a subject, verb, and object/complement.
    - Contain only one action, event, or idea. Avoid compound sentences.
    - Include no more than two or three entities per key fact. If there are more than three entities, divide them into separate sentences.
    - Present temporal information (e.g., when, how long) as standalone sentences.
    - Present causal relationships (e.g., reasons, consequences) as standalone sentences.
    - Avoid using linking words like ’and,’ ’but,’ ’then,’ or ’because.’ Each idea must be presented as an independent fact.
    - Do not combine related details, even implicitly. Each sentence must describe exactly one action, idea, or relationship.
2. Here are the examples of key-fact structure granularity:
    - Text Example: The resolution authorizes the operation of one winter shelter from December 1st, 2019, to March 31st, 2020.
    - Key-facts (Revised):
        (a) The resolution authorizes the operation of one winter shelter.
        (b) The winter shelter will operate from December 1st, 2019, to March 31st, 2020.
    - Text Example : The property for the winter shelter was purchased using homeless emergency aid program funding.
    - Key-facts (Revised):
        (a) The property for the winter shelter was purchased.
        (b) Homeless emergency aid program funding was used for the purchase.
3. Categorize Key-facts:
    - Define your own categories for the key-facts based on content.
    - Assign each key-fact to a category.
4. Compare Categories:
    - Compare your defined categories with the provided key-fact categories.
    - Adjust any key-fact to better align with the provided categories.
5. Validate Key-facts
    - Ensure each key-fact meets the following criteria:
        - Correctly categorized.
        - Atomicity: Conveys only one action, event, or idea.
        - Clarity: Is concise and clear, avoiding ambiguity.
        - Brevity: Contains no unnecessary details.
        - Non-overlapping: Does not duplicate information in other facts.
    - Finalize key facts that satisfy these conditions.
